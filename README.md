# Spoiler Categories (contains no serious spoilers)

## Introduction

This text is written for people who want to talk more clearly about different kinds of spoilers.

Jump to "Kinds of Spoilers" if you're in a hurry ;)

## Background

People have varying ideas of what a spoiler is, and what it is not.

From Wikipedia:
> "A spoiler is [...] a [...] description of any piece of fiction that reveals any plot elements which threaten to give away important details. Typically, [...] the conclusion of the plot [...] are especially regarded as spoiler material."

> "It can also be used to refer to any piece of information regarding any part of a given media that a potential consumer was not intended to know beforehand."

This definition gives a basic idea what a spoiler is.
It does **not** give us good ideas, what we can talk about when someone asks not to be spoiled though!

Therefore we need categories!

I'm mostly concerned about video games here (in the context of streaming gameplay on twitch), so I will focus on that perspective.

## Kinds of Spoilers

### [S] Story spoiler (plot twists)
Gives away part of the story, like an important character dies unexpectedly or a good guy turns bad.

Example: "I am your father"

### [H] Hint spoiler
Gives hints about how to enjoy the game.

Example: "You should get the Master Sword, it's much better than the one you have."

Example: "If you donâ€™t have a poison type for this area... good luck!"

Problematic for: People who want to learn things on their own and just experience the game *as if* they played alone.

### [C] Content spoiler
Gives away details about the content that the game provides, like how many types of enemies or collectables are in the game.

Example: "There are 600 seeds you can collect"

Problematic especially for: Completionists who want to discover collectables on their own.

Knowing these numbers can feel ovewhelming or disappointing.

### [A] Anticipation spoiler
Gives away the anticipation of what happens next, like changes in difficulty.

Example: "Prepare to die a lot at the next boss."

Example: "Next cutscene is so cute!"

Example: "Here it comes..."

### [M] Mechanics spoiler
Gives away how the game is played, e.g. in a game where you fight with swords, you suddenly get a gun.

Example: "You'll soon be able to dash twice."

### [M] Missing out spoiler
Gives away something that you technically have seen already (it was on the screen), but you forgot about it or didn't realize it was there.

The best way to address this is to say: "You missed something, do you want to know more?" instead of just pointing out what they missed.
Because usually you don't really know if they missed it or ignored it on purpose.

### [F] Fake spoiler
Gives away something, but is actually a lie.

Why are they problematic: You never know if the person being spoiled is aware that the spoiler is a lie. This is true especially when the game subverts expectations and the spoiler *could* be true.

Problematic for: Story enthusiasts who don't know much about the universe yet, so they cannot distingush it from a real spoiler. So they *think* they are being spoiled.

Put together, that spells the easy to remember ;) word
*SHCAMPF*


# My Personal Spoiler Preferences

All of the categories are technically spoilers.

Personally, I don't mind the [M]issing out spoilers, but I don't like any of the others, unless they are maybe **very** minor.

So my spoiler type would be *SHCAPF* :D
